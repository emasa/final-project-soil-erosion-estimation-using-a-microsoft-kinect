This work presents the development of a laboratory method that quantifies soil erosion and sediment accumulation in a scale model. After each test, a Microsoft Kinect RGB-D camera is used for depth measurement on areas of interest and as a result a digital elevation map can be built automatically.\\
Traditional approaches to collect erosion data are based on hand-operated measuring using an automatic level and a tape measure. The proposed technique emerges from a pressing need to get a more precise and efficient method than previous solutions. \\
This novel solution exhibits several aspects that outperform the traditional approach. Primarily, it's not an intrusive solution, i.e., it doesn't alter the model condition. Besides, this method dramatically increases the spatial resolution of the resultant 3D representation, it allows to cover wider areas and it significantly decreases working time for each test scenery. After several experiments, it was observed that the solution proposed at this work gives more precise outcomes than those measured with the automatic level approach. \\
